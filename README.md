**Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN**

This repository contains an **image classification system** for **hand gestures** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.
The model is trained on the **LEAP Gesture Recognition dataset** and can predict hand gestures from images.

---

## 📌 Objective

* Develop a **CNN-based model** to recognize hand gestures.
* Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the gesture dataset.
* Evaluate the model using **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report**.
* Enable real-time prediction of gestures from images.

## 📂 Dataset
Dataset :-  https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog
The dataset used for this task is the **LEAP Gesture Recognition dataset**.

**Features / Structure:**

* Images of hand gestures organized into folders per gesture class.
* Each folder contains multiple images of a specific gesture.

**Example Gesture Classes:**

* `Palm`
* `Fist`
* `Thumbs Up`
* `Index Point`
* `Peace Sign`
  *(Exact classes depend on dataset used)*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **PyTorch** for CNN implementation
* **OpenCV** for image processing
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualization
* **NumPy**, **Pandas**

## 🚀 Steps Involved

1. Load and explore the dataset (EDA)
2. Visualize **sample images** and **class distribution**
3. Check **image sizes and integrity**
4. Preprocess images and apply transformations
5. Define a **Simple CNN model**
6. Split dataset into **training and testing sets**
7. Train the model and monitor loss
8. Evaluate performance using **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report**
9. Predict individual images using the trained model

## 📊 Results

* The model achieved satisfactory 95% on the test set (depends on training epochs).
* Confusion matrix shows correct classification across gesture classes.
* Sample predictions validate the model’s ability to recognize gestures.
* EDA plots help understand the dataset distribution and image variations.
